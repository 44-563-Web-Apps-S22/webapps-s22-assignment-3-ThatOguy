        <h3>Linear Algebra Algorithm</h3>

        <blockquote>
            The rank of a matrix is the largest number of linearly independent rows/columns of the matrix. The rank is not only defined for square matrices.

            The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.
            
            Let the matrix be rectangular and have size N x M. Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is N (=M); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed min(N,M).
